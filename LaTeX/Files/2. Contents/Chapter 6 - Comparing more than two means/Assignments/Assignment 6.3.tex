\rassignment{Implementing an ANOVA as a regression in R}

Now that you have seen the results of the \concept{ANOVA}, let’s try to replicate these by implementing the same \concept{ANOVA} as a \concept{linear regression}. Remember that this is exactly what you did for the \concept{t-test} in assignment 6.1 by adding one \concept{dummy variable} to your model that isolated the \rcode{Brown} group. For the \concept{ANOVA}, you are going to have three \concept{dummy variables} in your model, one that represents  \rcode{Brown} eyes, one that represents \rcode{Blue} eyes, and one that represents \rcode{Green} eyes. You first have to add these dummy variables to your data set. \\

Run the following code in \texttt{R} that adds a \concept{dummy variable} for \rcode{Brown} eyes to the data set: \\

\codeblock{dummyBrown <- as.numeric(dataset8\$Group == \textquotesingle Brown\textquotesingle) \\
dataset8   <- cbind(dataset8, dummyBrown)}

\question{
    Add two more \concept{dummy variables} to the data in \rcode{dataset8}, one for \rcode{Blue} eyes and one for \rcode{Green} eyes. Name these variables \rcode{dummyBlue} and \rcode{dummyGreen}.

\question{
    Create a \concept{linear model} in \texttt{R} where you predict the (outcome) variable \rcode{Score} using the (predictor) variables \rcode{dummyBrown}, \rcode{dummyGreen}, and \rcode{dummyBlue}. Store the fitted \concept{linear model} in an object called \rcode{anovaReg}.

\question{
    Use the \rcode{summary()} function to inspect the results of the \concept{linear model} stored in \rcode{anovaReg}. What is the \concept{F-value} of the model? What is the \concept{p-value} of this model?

\question{
    Do the \concept{F-value} and \concept{p-value} of this \concept{linear model} match those of the \concept{ANOVA} in assignment 6.2?
