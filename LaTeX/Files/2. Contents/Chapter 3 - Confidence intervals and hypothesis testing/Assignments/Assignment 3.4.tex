% Assignment 3.4: Inspect and test the normality of a sample in R
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\rassignment{Inspecting and testing the normality of a sample in R}

In this assignment you are going to work with an \texttt{R} package called \rcode{car}. Packages are extensions for \texttt{R} created by its community. They contain functions that are not available in the basic \texttt{R} version and can be really useful. There are many packages on the internet, so only use the one you really need and always make sure you use packages from a reliable source (like the official \rcode{CRAN} servers). For clarity, it will be indicated what functions come from what packages in the chapters. If there is no package mentioned, functions come from base \texttt{R}. \\

A package has to be installed once. Run the following code in R to install the car package: \\

\codeblock{install.packages(\textquotesingle car\textquotesingle)}

A package needs to be loaded in \textbf{every script} that uses functions from this package by a call to the \rcode{library()} function. Run the following code in \texttt{R} to load the \rcode{car} package into your environment. \\

\codeblock{library(car)}

This assignment assumes you have done assignment 3.3 and therefore have four $n = 90$ samples called \rcode{sample1} - \rcode{sample4} from populations \rcode{P1} - \rcode{P4} from \rcode{dataset5} and calculated the \concept{confidence intervals} for the population means. \\

\question{
    Create a histogram for each sample in \rcode{sample1} - \rcode{sample4}.
}

\question{ 
    Which samples look like they could have been taken from a \concept{normal distribution}?
}

\question{
    Use this \texttt{R} code (from the \rcode{car} package) to create four \concept{qq-plots} for the four \concept{samples}. 
}

\codeblock{qqPlot(sample1, distribution = \textquotesingle norm\textquotesingle) {\color{dataset}\# qqPlot for sample 1}}

\question{
    Evaluate each \concept{qq-plot} and explain the deviations from the diagonal by referencing features of the histograms. Do the \concept{qq-plots} confirm your answer for question 3.4b?

\question{
    Formulate the \concept{null hypothesis} $H_0$  and \concept{alternative hypothesis} $H_1$ for a test of normality in these samples.
}

\hypothesesbox

\question{
    Use the following \texttt{R} code to perform a \concept{Shapiro-Wilk} normality test on the four samples. Use a confidence level of 99\% and write down the conclusion for each sample.
}

\codeblock{shapiro.test(sample1) {\color{dataset}\# Normality test for sample 1}}

\hint{First think about what \concept{p-values} lead to rejecting the \concept{null hypothesis} $H_0$.}

In assignment 3.3 you used these \concept{samples} and the \concept{normal distribution} to estimate the \concept{confidence interval} for the \concept{population mean}. You also tested whether the actual \concept{population means} were inside these intervals, which they almost always were. \\

Now you found out that most of these \concept{samples} are actually not normally distributed at all. \\

\question{
    If a \concept{sample} is not normally distributed, does that mean you cannot use it to estimate the \concept{population mean}? Explain your answer.
}

\emptyanswerbox{
    When the sample is not normally distributed, the sample \textbf{can} / \textbf{cannot} be used to estimate the population mean.
