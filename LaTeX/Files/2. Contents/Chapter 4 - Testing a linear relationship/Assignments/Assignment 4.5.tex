\rassignment{Making predictions using linear regression in R}

The manager now wants to know what will happen to the number of milk cartons that she has to throw away when she lowers the price of a milk carton by 30 cents, from \$1.00 to \$0.70. Currently, the supermarket throws away 4 cartons of milk each day. \\

\question{
    Create a new data frame that has only one column that includes the new value for the price of milk (the column has to be named exactly the same as in \rcode{dataset7}).
}

The \rcode{predict()} function can be used to predict new data according to a \concept{linear model}. \\

\question{
    Use the \rcode{predict()} function to predict the number of milk cartons that the supermarket will have to throw away when the \rcode{Price} is \$0.70.
}

    Predicted value: \shortanswerline
}

\question{
    Confirm this estimate by writing out the regression equation of the \concept{linear model} from assignment 4.4e and filling in the new value of the price of milk. 
}

    Predicted value: \mediumanswerline
}

The \rcode{predict()} function can also be used to construct a \concept{confidence interval} for the predicted number of cartons thrown away by using \rcode{interval = \textquotesingle prediction\textquotesingle}. \\

\question{
    When the manager lowers her price from \$1.00 to \$0.70, will the supermarket throw away fewer cartons of milk? Incorporate the 90\% \concept{confidence interval} for the predicted value in your answer.
