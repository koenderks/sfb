\rassignment{Specifying and interpreting a prior distribution}

In this final chapter we move away from the traditional statistical methods that you have learned (\concept{confidence intervals} and \concept{p-values}), and introduce a different methodology; Bayesian statistics. Bayesian statistics expresses the most basic idea in learning, namely, that your prior belief in an event is updated to a posterior belief after observing data. By first specifying your prior beliefs, you allow yourself to learn from the data that you have collected, thereby updating your prior belief to a more informed posterior belief. Bayesian statistics is a powerful tool that can help you to update your existing beliefs in the context of new business information. \\

In Bayesian inference, your prior beliefs about a \concept{parameter} are expressed through a \concept{probability distribution}. For example, in tossing a coin, the probability of heads occurring may be defined as a \concept{parameter} $\theta$. Your initial probability distribution (i.e., beliefs) on $\theta$ is called the \concept{prior distribution}, which can be interpreted quite visually. The figure below shows three possible prior distributions for the probability of heads in a coin toss. The area under the curve represents probability.

\question{
    Interpret the three \concept{prior distributions} above and discuss what information about the probability $\theta$ of the coin occurring on heads they incorporate.

When estimating a proportion (like the probability of heads in a coin toss) you can use the common $Beta(\alpha,\, \beta)$ distribution as a prior distribution on $\theta$ since it is restricted to the range [0, 1]. The $Beta(\alpha,\, \beta)$ distribution has two parameters, $\alpha$ and $\beta$, that have an effect on its shape. By playing around with these parameters, you can create the \concept{prior distribution} that reflects your particular beliefs as accurately as possible. \\

Run the following code in \texttt{R} to create the \concept{prior distribution} shown on the left of the figure above: \\

\codeblock{alpha <- 1 \\
beta <- 1 \\
curve(dbeta(x, alpha, beta), xlab = expression(theta), ylab = \textquotesingle\textquotesingle, yaxt = \textquotesingle n\textquotesingle)}

\question{Recreate the middle and right \concept{prior distributions} from the figure by changing the values for \rcode{alpha} and \rcode{beta} and running the code again. What are the values of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ for these distributions?}

\question{How would you define a \concept{prior distribution} for $\theta$ if you believed the coin was definitely biased towards heads? And for one that is biased towards tails? Draw these \concept{prior distributions} below.}
