% Assignment 5.4: Dependent two-sample t-test in R
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\rassignment{Dependent two-sample t-test in R}

To test for a difference in blood pressure depending on their position, 14 peopleâ€™s blood pressure was measured twice, first standing up and then sitting down. Researchers want to use this experiment to show with 92.5\% confidence that the blood pressure sitting is significantly higher than standing. They are going to evaluate the results by comparing the \concept{mean} using a \concept{two-sample t-test}.\\

\question{
    Why is this a dependent (also called paired) \concept{t-test}?
}

Run the following code in \texttt{R}: \\

\codeblock{{\color{dataset}\# These are the values for the blood pressure data set} \\
standing <- c(136, 144, 152, 133, 140, 129, 131, 133, 145, 134, 142, 140, 125, 135) \\
sitting <- c(148, 159, 121, 151, 145, 139, 135, 144, 141, 148, 143, 161, 150, 151)}

\question{
    Calculate the \concept{mean} of the \rcode{standing} and \rcode{sitting} data sets, also calculate the differences and the \concept{mean} of the differences.

\question{
    Write down the \concept{null hypothesis} $H_0$ and \concept{alternative hypothesis} $H_1$ for a one-sided test where the researchers want to show with 92.5\% confidence that the \concept{mean} blood pressure is higher sitting down than standing up.

Run the following code in \texttt{R}: \\

\codeblock{t.test(x = standing, y = sitting, alternative = \textquotesingle greater\textquotesingle, mu = 0 , \\
       \hspace*{40pt}paired = TRUE, conf.level = 0.925)}
       
\question{
    Check the results of this test. The outcome is a bit strange, can you explain what is wrong here?

\question{
    Fix the \texttt{R} code to do a correct test and draw the correct (four part) conclusion.
